<!-- Learning divs, but we won't really be able to utilize them until we learn about CSS! They are useful when adding in style using CSS. --> 

<!-- Divs stands for division (meaning separating something into parts of groups, dividing into groups) and allows you to group elements together. --> 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head> <!-- contains metadata --> 
    <meta charset = "utf-8"> <!-- what character set you would expect (utf-8) -->
        
        <title>This is the Title!</title> <!-- no quotes, just text --> 
    </head>
    
    <body> <!--contains content-->
    <!-- comment, control forward slash comments -->
        <h1>Divs and Spans</h1>
        <h1>Group One</h1>
        <p>I am not in the same group as Group one.</p>
        <div class="GroupTwo"> <!-- in the quotatoin marks, you type in the class name (name of the group) --> 
        <h1>Group Two</h1>
            <p> I am in the same group as Group Two.</p>
            <!-- Span tag groups things that are on the same line (inline). Again, there will be no difference until you apply styles using CSS.--> 
        <p>Hello I want to use the <span>span</span> tag.</p>
        </div>
        <!-- you won't notice anything different in the HTML, but later, you can add different styles to a division (div) with a class name. -->
